### Deployment

Deployment of a Dokkie website is really easy. Just create your repository with Markdown files and deploy it. You don't need to install Dokkie anywhere. You can find more information on [the Dokkie documentation](https://dokkie.dev/usage/deployment).

This website is deployed using the following command;

```bash
npx dokkie --type=website --projectTitle=Dokkie Example
```
